<p>This first post goes out to my coders out there.
<br>
<br>
Do you ever tire of making Wordpress sites, simply so that the client has the ability to update their blog on their own? I know I do, so I ran into a bit of a problem when I set out to make my own blog...
<blockquote>To Wordpress or not to Wordpress?</blockquote>
Sure, there are other CMS [content management systems] out there (Drupal, Joomla...), but I wanted to have a blog that I could custom style 100% on my own, without needing to be insanely good at PHP. That said, I didn't want it to be super complicated just to upload an individual post. 
<br>
<br>
There were a few CMS systems that showed some hope for what I was looking for (<a href="http://anchorcms.com" target="_blank">AnchorCMS</a>, among others), but I was never totally satisfied with them. And then I started to lose hope when I remembered that any basic blog has the essential ability for visitors to post comments. That requires a complicated mySQL database though, right? No, it doesn't.
<br>
<br>
Enter <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, one of the coolest tools I've come across since first entering the world of web development. Their home page says it all: "Transform your plain text into static websites and blogs." Exactly what I was looking for. Making a blog without needing to use a CMS.
<br>
<br>
And as for the comments ability, I found that many Jekyll-based sites use <a href="https://disqus.com" target="_blank">DISQUS</a>, a simple yet versatile commenting plugin.
<br>
<br>
After a quick setup of Jekyll (it requires only 2 lines of terminal command and your favorite text editor), I set off to build the blog I wanted - custom styled everything.
<br>
<br>
And for those of you wondering, that styling is a work in progress.</p>
