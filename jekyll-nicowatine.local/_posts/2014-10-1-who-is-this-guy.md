<p>My name is Nico (in case you missed the title of this website.) I'm a web developer, and this site is where I talk to myself.
<br>
<br>
Me in one sentence: I have an awesome fianc&eacute;e, I like photography, and love to code.
<br>
<br>
To make a short story long::
<br>
In my last job I made deliveries all over our fair city of Houston. All the photos on this website I took myself, while out and about working. That was basically the only cool thing about that job. Back then I used to run a website called Houston Uncovered where I would post my daily pictures. Before that it was called HoustonPhotoBlog.net (yes, I know, a boring and unoriginal title for yet an AWESOME website.)
<br>
<br>
If you Google my name, some images and links to Pinterest will pop up with pictures I once posted to my site. These pics were later re-pinned by the same 3 readers that followed me - my fianc&eacute;e, my mom, and this one really kind stranger. Yep, I'm a bit of a celebrity you might say.
<br>

Thanks for reading. Enjoy my ramblings!
