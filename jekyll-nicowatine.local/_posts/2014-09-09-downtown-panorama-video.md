<p>This is a video I shot while driving in the car through downtown Houston. I was on the Pierce Elevated section of I-45 North (in the passenger seat of course.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately if you're on mobile, the video background won't play (bandwidth reasons and all.) You can always watch the <a href="http://youtu.be/n2i9H5CJzwc" target="_blank">YouTube</a> upload.</p>
<p>To my fellow nerds out there - if you're interested in checking out the code behind this HTML5 <kbd>video</kbd> background, see <a href="http://demosthenes.info/blog/777/Create-Fullscreen-HTML5-Page-Background-Video" target="_blank">this</a> article.</p>
